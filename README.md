 <summary>👨‍💻 More on My Data Journey</summary>
 
 <p>Driven by my passion for data and a desire to strengthen my finance profile, I pursued a Master’s degree in Management Control and Business Intelligence. During my studies, I honed my skills in data modeling, reporting, and business intelligence solutions.</p>

  <p>At Orange Tunisie, I served as a Controller & Business Analyst, where I developed decision-making solutions and automated ETL processes. My work involved creating interactive Power BI dashboard that provided real-time insights into business performance.</p>

  <p>Currently, as a Corporate Costing Coordinator at COFICAB Group, I analyze and manage costs for the North America region, ensuring accurate and timely costing. I am also developing a costing tool using SQL and Python, and creating profitability dashboards on SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC).</p>

  <p>I remain deeply passionate about data analysis and continuously seek opportunities to apply my specialization in Power BI and SQL to solve complex problems and drive business success. To further enhance my skillset and navigate the evolving data landscape, I am actively exploring additional courses.</p>
